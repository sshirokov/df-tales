A small hole in the dirt will serve for now. Luxury is for elves, in who's name we cut down every tree around our soon to be proud home.  We don't need the wagon, but we don't need its wood. It will serve as a monument to our travels.

Our stuff is in the ground, where it belongs. The sun is far to bright to trust with things as important as alcohol.

A good moments work calls for a good moment of idling. This are has been declared a meeting spot. As good a hole as any.
