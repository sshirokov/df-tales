*Ablel Ralemath* is quick to work.

### 9th Granitite, 126 - Early Spring

Our most ambitious work. The great wall has been architected. This wall will be the basis of our tower,
complete with iron drawbridge.

### 22nd Granite, 126 - Early Spring

The arrival of the elves reminds me that I haven't killed enough things.

Space is made for a butcher shop.

`'Dear Leader' Cattenudib` attends a party rather than trading with the elves. I cannot blame her.

### 28th Granite, 126 - Early Spring

Some migrants arrive, apearntly in awe of our plan for a tower.

This was too much for `Thikut Ningasen`, who is taken by a mood.
