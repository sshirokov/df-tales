## :construction: **STRIKE THE EARTH!** :construction:

A small hole in the dirt will serve for now. Luxury is for elves, in who's name we cut down every tree around our soon to be proud home.  We don't need the wagon, but we don't need its wood. It will serve as a monument to our travels.

Our stuff is in the ground, where it belongs. The sun is far to bright to trust with things as important as alcohol.

A good moments work calls for a good moment of idling. This area has been declared a meeting spot. As good a hole as any.

### 23rd Slate, 125 - Mid-Spring

I wouldn't say we're the quickest.

![Not like we have anything better to do](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3t0V1y3d251l/Image%202014-07-28%20at%204.35.33%20AM.png)

### 25 Slate, 125 - Mid-Spring

Public works are under way to make sure that drink and food is available to those that deserve it.

Our food storage and kitchen areas have been designed.

As well as a place to grow something called "crops." Someone must have heard of it. *Erib Steruseral* asures us we can drink it one day.

### 2nd Felsite, 125 - Late Spring

As *Erib* worked on the kitchen, he shouted something about needing space for a still. Suddenly, there was some!

![Just like that](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1m2K1B302Y0P/Image%202014-07-29%20at%202.19.40%20AM.png)

### 12th Felsite, 125 - Late Spring

We have a kitchen, a still and a place to store the results.

![Both of them](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2I1K1j0S2E26/Image%202014-07-29%20at%202.28.27%20AM.png)

Life can finally go on, and does, in the construction of the farmlands:

Within days, the hard "farming" begins

### 20th Felsite, 125 - Late Spring

Work begins on industry. *Solon* and *Alath* dig the spaces for the heart of industry inside **Ropegrave**
