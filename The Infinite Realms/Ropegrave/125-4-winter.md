Labor shortages prevented additional mining. More promotions all around!

They'll be near the surface, for quick response times.


### 22nd Moonstone, 125 - Early Winter

I will find a place to display them in time.

### 27th Moonstone, 125 - Early Winter

*Miner, Alath Libashsokan* understands the dwarven priority for murder. Preferring to work on the military grounds
rather than the simple storage of things.

![Nice](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3R01102f1P05/Image%202014-08-02%20at%2012.36.26%20AM.png)

He is joined by *Miner, Ablel Ralemath* another dwarf of good sensibilities.

![Yep, here](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2v3X302R2Z2i/Image%202014-08-02%20at%2012.39.44%20AM.png)

### 3rd Opal, 125 - Mid-Winter

Since violence is so important, plans are laid to begin the work before construction is complete.

![War will follow](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0A0l0s3i0Y3w/Image%202014-08-02%20at%2012.42.26%20AM.png)

Armor and weapons as well

### 7th Opal, 125 - Mid-Winter

It's time to form the first militia. The lucky few will get to use the shiny new armor.

*The Oceanic Spurs* are hand selected, and will make us proud.

![The Oceanic Spurs](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2B3Y0x3O3w40/Image%202014-08-02%20at%2012.51.05%20AM.png)

In theory, they should be wearing the metal armor, hot from the forges.

One does not lead a militia without gaining a new name, as *'Rambo' Imushemal* now learns

### 28th Opal, 125 - Mid-Winter

The War Complex as well as the finished goods stockpile are done.

Training has already started. I'm proud of the work that the *The Oceanic Spurs* are doing.
