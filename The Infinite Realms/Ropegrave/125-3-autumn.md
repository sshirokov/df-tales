Autumn has come

In response to the summer drink scare, another still is being installed.

Most likely without real need. But more is always better.

### 7th Limestone, 125 - Early Autumn

The jewler is finally in place. The gems are moving, and the cutting of gems is scheduled.

*Peasant Sodel Imushemal* is promoted to jewler.

And the Drink Emergency of Late Summer, 125 has been resolved! Drink levels are 33, for 10 dwarves.
There's also some food.

### 13th Limestone, 125 - Early Autumn

An outpost liason has arrived, along with a caravan.

I think we can trust them both.

In an attempt to finally build traps around the **COMPLETELY UNGUARDED HOLE IN THE GROUND** that represents our
mountainhome entrance I was told I that mechanisms are required. In a rage, I declare the construction of some begin.

Also, a floor hatch of stone.

I'm surprised we've made it this far.

*'Dear Leader' Cattenudib* is requested at the trade depot in anticipation of the caravan, as all of our rough gems
are moved for trade. We were not well prepared this season. Let's hope we see another.

As the merchants unload it is decided we will enter the metals industury. Space is designated for a smelter
and a forge.

![So fucking metal](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0P1K2020310O/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.43.39%20AM.png)

Our therapist assures us we won't have a problem.

![None at all](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0z1N0r3M0p3Q/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.44.39%20AM.png)
