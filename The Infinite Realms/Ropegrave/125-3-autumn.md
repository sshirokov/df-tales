### 1st Limestone, 125 - Early Autumn

Autumn has come

![Here we are](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1z341B0F3u3v/Image%202014-07-30%20at%204.02.27%20AM.png)

In response to the summer drink scare, another still is being installed.

![Still 2.0](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1X3c3D311p00/Image%202014-07-30%20at%204.03.10%20AM.png)

Most likely without real need. But more is always better.

### 7th Limestone, 125 - Early Autumn

The jewler is finally in place. The gems are moving, and the cutting of gems is scheduled.

![Jelwer](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3h3o180Q3h0Z/Image%202014-07-30%20at%204.09.04%20AM.png)

*Peasant Sodel Imushemal* is promoted to jewler.

And the Drink Emergency of Late Summer, 125 has been resolved! Drink levels are 33, for 10 dwarves.
There's also some food.

### 13th Limestone, 125 - Early Autumn

An outpost liason has arrived, along with a caravan.

![He has](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2s3R0y0X2S46/Image%202014-07-30%20at%204.16.38%20AM.png)

I think we can trust them both.

![Dwarves](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/040i2L0I1R3Z/Image%202014-07-30%20at%204.17.47%20AM.png)

![And dwarves again](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2f2p010V3P2r/Image%202014-07-30%20at%204.19.56%20AM.png)

In an attempt to finally build traps around the **COMPLETELY UNGUARDED HOLE IN THE GROUND** that represents our
mountainhome entrance I was told I that mechanisms are required. In a rage, I declare the construction of some begin.

Also, a floor hatch of stone.

![About time](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1R0D3x2w440G/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.36.24%20AM.png)

I'm surprised we've made it this far.

*'Dear Leader' Cattenudib* is requested at the trade depot in anticipation of the caravan, as all of our rough gems
are moved for trade. We were not well prepared this season. Let's hope we see another.

![Merchants](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0o362J2K1e0m/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.45.43%20AM.png)

As the merchants unload it is decided we will enter the metals industury. Space is designated for a smelter
and a forge.

![So fucking metal](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0P1K2020310O/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.43.39%20AM.png)

Our therapist assures us we won't have a problem.

![None at all](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0z1N0r3M0p3Q/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.44.39%20AM.png)

### 24th Limestone, 125 - Early Autumn

Trading begins.

I attempt to buy a few picks for my rough gems, at a terrible profit for the merchant.

![Crap Profit](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0N3Q3f0i3t0r/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.57.47%20AM.png)

A reasonable counter is presented, as far as I can tell

![Not crap](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1H3r022w0o3D/Image%202014-08-01%20at%201.58.16%20AM.png)

I accept. Might as well have some more picks and good relations.

![Everyone is happy](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1t01082D2S09/Image%202014-08-01%20at%202.01.09%20AM.png)

The smelter and forger are finally planned. Great is the memory of the overlord.

A direct reminder to fire up the furnaces.

![Fire](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1I2i0m1x082m/Image%202014-08-01%20at%202.50.13%20AM.png)
