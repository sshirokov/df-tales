It is now summer.

![Here's how we are](http://f.cl.ly/items/0R2r1S1P1k320c1i453e/Image%202014-07-29%20at%203.01.42%20AM.png)

Our Leader began to work with a [therapist](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=128960.msg5519025#msg5519025).
We have no choice but enjoy it.

With the beginnings of industry starting to function:

![With arrows and everything](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0Z0m3Z2Z302S/2014-07-29%20at%203.28%20AM.png)

We begin to prepare for management, who we're told by The Leadership will help us all drink and sleep better.

As the digging of the economic stone pile continues, *Solon Eralzoz*, the Miner, apperantly in a defiant show of weakness,
falls asleep on the job

![ZZ](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/021n3e0j2E25/Image%202014-07-29%20at%203.40.15%20AM.png)

She is alone in her decision

![No ZZ](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3b1p0A3B2X17/Image%202014-07-29%20at%203.42.53%20AM.png)

And awakens soon enough to resume work with *Alath Libashsokan*

![Work](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3f2y1V332F1s/Image%202014-07-29%20at%203.45.14%20AM.png)

Who then immediately does the exact same thing

![ZZZ 2.0](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1a3y1L0g3k3o/Image%202014-07-29%20at%203.47.35%20AM.png)

Plans are laid to burn wood into charcoal, as well as a place for sleep.

![Fire fire fire](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0P2A2H0U1s0X/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.08.53%20AM.png)

This will have to do until production improves.

### 17th Malachite, 125 - Mid-Summer

As soon as the furnace was constructed, orders are in motion to make fuel.

![Orders](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2g1f3S1n2A2D/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.13.43%20AM.png)

A named overview of the fort so far, somewhat aspirational

![Plan](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0H2m3i0h2T40/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.17.44%20AM.png)

### 27th Malachite, 125 - Mid-Summer

Just in time for *Sleep Force One* to go live

![Sleep Force One](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/3X1F3g33403t/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.23.01%20AM.png)

### 9th Galena, 125 - Late Summer

The meeting area serving **Ropegrave** until now has finally been forgotten. The first dining room
has been built around what is certain to become a renowned artifact

![Table](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2F410a2x2c1D/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.33.48%20AM.png)

Upwards of several Dwarves are very pleased, *'Dear Leader' Cattenudib* and *Solon Eralzoz* are the first
in. As is clearly visible.

### 14th Galena, 125 - Late Summer

*'Dear Leader' Cattenudib* lays the first stone herself in the building of our siltstone trade depo.

![Depot](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/312q23091818/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.39.42%20AM.png)

It will be built next to the very wagon that brought **The Mountain Tools** here to build **Ropegrave**

### 21st Galena, 125 - Late Summer

Gems are starting to clog the general stockpile.

![Gems..](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1l150d181B3s/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.45.52%20AM.png)

This prompts the design of the Jewler's area in the industrial floor of the fortress

![Shiny rocks](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1n2T2P1m3y1d/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.46.43%20AM.png)

Complete with split storage!

**MEANWHILE**

*Alath Libashsokan* makes steady progress on the trade depot. His efforts won't go unnoticed.

![Building](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/1M3a3L401B42/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.48.44%20AM.png)


### 25th Galena, 125 - Late Summer

A state of emergency is fast approaching.

![Drinks are leaving us](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/0L2o3l011t1z/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.52.28%20AM.png)

There are three drinks left for everyone. Therapy reveals why.

![Woops](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/image/2h3C1O3A3R3s/Image%202014-07-30%20at%203.53.37%20AM.png)

Promotions take place.

*Peasant Sodel Imushemal*, *Planter Erib Steruseral*, and *Farmer Doren Rakustzaled* are informed that they are now
entirely qualified to operate the stills.
